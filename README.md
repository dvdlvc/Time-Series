# The Statistical Analysis of Time Series


## Reproducing some of the plots available in the slides

This repository contains Rnotebook links for some lecturs of my [time series](https://wadme.unige.ch:3349/pls/opprg/w_det_cours.debut?p_annee=2019&p_code_cours=S403107&p_frame=N&p_grtri=&p_langue=1&p_mode=PGC&p_plan_is=0&p_suffixe=) class at University of Geneva, in the [Master of Science in Statistics](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/programs/masters/statistics/). The links yield to www.rnotebook.io a web-based application. No need to download R on the laptop: you only need an internet connection and a browser (e.g. [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)).

I itemize the links

1. For the [Welcome lecture](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Time-Series/blob/master/Welcome_TimeSeries.ipynb)

2. For the [Realized Volatility modeling](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Time-Series/blob/master/HAR_RV_Handbout.html)
