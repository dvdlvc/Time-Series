# The Statistical Analysis of Time Series


This repository contains Rnotebook links for some lecturs of my course The Statistical Analysis of Time Series, at University of Geneva, in the [Master of Science in Statistics](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/programs/masters/statistics/). To run the files you may use Jupyter Notebook, a web-based application---no need for downloading R on the laptop: you only need an internet connection and a browser (e.g. [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)).

I itemize the links

1. For the [Welcome lecture](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Time-Series/blob/master/Welcome_TimeSeries.ipynb)

2. For the [Realized Volatility modeling](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Time-Series/blob/master/HAR_RV_Handbout.html.zip)

Additional reading on 

1. [Exogeneity in OLS estimation](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Time-Series/blob/master/Exogeneity.pdf) 

2. [Causality in Machine Learning](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Time-Series/blob/master/Peter_etal_2009.pdf)

3. [Generative Models for time series](https://github.com/dvdlvc/Time-Series/blob/master/NeurIPS-2019-time-series-generative-adversarial-networks-Paper.pdf)
